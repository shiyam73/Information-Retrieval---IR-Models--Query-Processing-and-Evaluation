The goal of this project is to gain some experience with different ranking algorithms and the
evaluation of their performance. As part of this project, you will need to build our own
query-processing module in an attempt to boost performance. By working on this project,
you will gain a deeper understanding of IR models as well as various evaluation metrics.
