Information-Retrieval---IR-Models--Query-Processing-and-Evaluation
==================================================================

The goal of this project is to gain some experience with different ranking algorithms and the
evaluation of their performance. We have built our own query-processing module in an attempt to boost performance. By working on this project,
I have gained a deeper understanding of IR models as well as various evaluation metrics.
